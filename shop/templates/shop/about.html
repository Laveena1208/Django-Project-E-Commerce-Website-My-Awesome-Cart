            <h1 class="display-3">My Awesome Cart!</h1>
            <p>My Awesome Cart Pvt Ltd. is an Indian electronic commerce company based in Bengaluru, India. Founded by
                Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal in 2007, the company initially focused on book sales, before expanding
                into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.
                The service competes primarily with Amazon' s Indian subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6]
                as of March 2017, My Awesome Cart held a 39.5% market share of India's e-commerce industry.[7] My
                Awesome Cart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its
                acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the
                sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on
                the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).
                In August 2018, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16
                billion, valuing it at $22 billion.</p>
